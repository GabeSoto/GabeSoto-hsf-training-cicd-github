title: "Handling Clones"
teaching: 5
exercises: 10
objectives:
  - Learn how GitLab CI/CD clones repositories
  - Get your submodule included/cloned
questions:
  - How are repositories cloned?
hidden: false
keypoints:
  - Git cloning strategies are configured with global (or per-job) variables
  - "`GIT_STRATEGY=none` is useful when you don't need any information/files from the repository"
  - Submodules can be cloned normally or recursively as needed
---

# Recursive cloning?

As of now, we only have a simple script that echoes `Hello World`. Presumably, we should have the repository cloned for us, but let's check.

If you successfully add the command, you'll get the following similar output in the CI job

## Where are the submodules?

Looking at the output we just got, we see lines like

~~~
Skipping Git submodules setup
...
...
./source/JetSelectionHelper
(nothing else under it???)
~~~
{: .output}

which indicates that we're not cloning the submodule at all. In fact, there are a couple of (global) variables we can set to change how the repository gets cloned. Let's go over them.

# Variables

The key variables we'll discuss in today's lession are:

- `:variables:GIT_STRATEGY` (`clone`, `fetch`, `none`)
- `:variables:GIT_SUBMODULE_STATEGY` (`none`, `normal`, `recursive`)

## Controlling git strategy

You can set the `:variables:GIT_STRATEGY` used for getting recent application code, either globally or per-job in the variables section. If left unspecified, the default from project settings will be used.

There are three possible values: `clone` (default), `fetch`, and `none`.

- `clone` is the slowest option. It clones the repository from scratch for every job, ensuring that the project workspace is always pristine.
- `fetch` is faster as it re-uses the project workspace (falling back to clone if it doesnâ€™t exist). `git clean` is used to undo any changes made by the last job, and git fetch is used to retrieve commits made since the last job ran.
- `none` also re-uses the project workspace, but skips all Git operations. It is mostly useful for jobs that operate exclusively on artifacts (e.g., deploy). You should only rely on files brought into the project workspace from cache or artifacts.

## Controlling git submodule strategy

The `GIT_SUBMODULE_STRATEGY` variable is used to control if / how Git submodules are included when fetching the code before a build. You can set them globally or per-job in the variables section.

There are three possible values: `none` (default), `normal`, and `recursive`:

- `none` means that submodules will not be included when fetching the project code. This is the default, which matches the pre-v1.10 behavior.
- `normal` means that only the top-level submodules will be included. It is equivalent to:
  ~~~
  git submodule sync
  git submodule update --init
  ~~~
  {: .source}
- `recursive` means that all submodules (including submodules of submodules) will be included. It is equivalent to:
  ~~~
  git submodule sync --recursive
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ~~~
  {: .source}

> ## Git submodule URL paths
>
> For this feature to work, you need to make sure that the submodules configured in `.gitmodules` are configured with either:
> - the HTTP(S) URL of a publicly-accessible repository, or
> - a relative path to another repository on the same GitLab server.
{: .callout}

Let's get our submodule cloned! Let's try and get it working with a simple change to the variable (removing the `GIT_STRATEGY` so we keep it on default):

~~~
variables:
 GIT_SUBMODULE_STRATEGY: recursive

hello world:
  script:
   - echo "Hello World"
   - find . -path ./.git -prune -o -print
~~~
{: .language-yaml}

Did this work? The output indicates the submodule got cloned!
