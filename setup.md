{: .prereq}

To ensure that your gitlab account is active, go to
[gitlab.cern.ch](gitlab.cern.ch).

You should find your very own gitlab homepage!

If you're having issues, **please notify your instructor immediately**
since you won't be able to follow this lesson without access to CERN's
Gitlab.

## Repo Permissions

Following the [setup for the payload](https://awesome-workshop.github.io/awesome-htautau-analysis/setup.html) to download a tarballof the files needed, you'll want to [create new projects](https://gitlab.cern.ch/projects/new?project[name]=awesome) on your personal gitlab account called `awesome-htautau-analysis` and `awesome-htautau-statistics` with the right visibility levels...

> ### Visibility Level
>
> Make sure you click Internal for the visibility level of the new project so your peers at CERN can see your awesome work.
