- "What do I need to start?"

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Most of the prerequisites should have been covered if you did the
> pre-workshop material.
>
> At a bare minimum:
> - You should have git working on your laptop
> - We assume that you already have a CERN account or access to a GitLab instance
> - We assume you have access to the payload tarball (see below)
{: .prereq}

To ensure that your gitlab account is active, go to
[gitlab.cern.ch](https://gitlab.cern.ch).

You should find your very own gitlab homepage!

If you're having issues, **please let us know immediately**
since you won't be able to follow this lesson without access to a GitLab
instance.

## Repo Permissions

Following the [setup for the payload](https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-cms-analysis-webpage/setup.html) to download a tarballof the files needed, you'll want to [create new projects](https://gitlab.cern.ch/projects/new) on your personal gitlab account called `virtual-pipelines-eventselection`. Please make sure to set the visibility level to **Public**.

> ### Visibility Level
>
> Make sure you click Public for the visibility level of the new project so that everyone can see your awesome work
> (and it will also make things easier when we get to working with containers).
